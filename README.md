# My Business Intelligence Gallery

This presentation is inspired by a desire to collect all the Data Analysis and BI visualization projects in one place, in order to show the importance of Visualizations in the decision making process of various Business and industries. Below is a catalog of projects that contain a BI component, and there is one that was a full BI Project on it's own.

## HR Analytics

Exploratory Data Analysis for Machine Learning and Communicating Insights to Business Stakeholders. Read more about the walkthrough of this analysis [here]().

Below is the dashboard created to communicate insights to Business Decision makers. This leads us to see the various reasons given by employees for terminations that the employer needs to pay attention to. This is also evidenced by the Attrition, Compensation and Age visual.

## Click-through Data Analysis

The scope of this project is to create an analytics report that summarizes the click-through data collected by Hospice Palliative Care, Ontario (HPCO) from its Newsletter Subscribers. The results of this analysis will help HPCO decide on the right marketing strategy to drive up subscriptions as well as subscriber engagement with their publications.

The raw data was obtained from HPCO constant contact data, which needed further specialized attention, breaking down the numbers, to obtain data that excluded HPCO employees, who were also subscribers to the Newsletter.

The tools used for executing this project was:

1. Microsoft Excel, which was useful in initial analysis and rearrangement of the data, for upload into the Business Intelligence Modeling tool.
2. Microsoft Power BI, the modeling tool, into which the data processed from Excel was imported, subsequently modeled, and manipulated to generate visuals for easy communication of the findings of the report to the Client (HPCO)

The final deliverable of this Project consisted of slide presentations of summary click-through data, and visual reports for each newsletter edition for the year in focus(June 10, 2020, to June 9, 2021). Some key insights to be gleaned from this reporting were the top clicks and bottom clicks with the click-rate data, as well as the types of information contained in those articles within the newsletter which received the most or least number of clicks. This does give clarity to the publishers of the newsletter on what interests readers, and how they can tailor their content creation to maximixe reader participation in the Hospice Care activities.

Here is a summary report and a monthly dashboard created in Power BI.

## Customer Segmentation

This was from a capstone project I executed in January 2021 using Python, and Tableau. The project details are found [here](https://github.com/ovokpus/Customer-Segmentation) and [here](https://github.com/ovokpus/my-bi-gallery/blob/main/customer-segmentation.md)

Here is the Tableau Dashboard showing key insights on Customer Cohorts, as well as clusters of customer groups which represent various purchasing behaviors of retail customers. This data, along with the story being told by the visualizations enable retail companies to tailor their offerings and advertising strategy in order to attract and keep high-value customers coming in through their doors, or making purchases online.

## Tweet Stream Visualization

This is a Power BI Dashboard used to consume a Data Engineering Pipeline, which was built in Microsoft Azure to stream in tweet messages from Hurricane Harvey Data, through Azure serverless functions, into Storage CosmosDB. The link to that project is [right here](https://github.com/ovokpus/my-bi-gallery/blob/main/tweet-stream-viz.md) and also [here](https://github.com/ovokpus/Azure-Streaming-Pipeline) for the Data Engineering source code.

Here is the dashboard created
