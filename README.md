## Click-through Data Analysis

The scope of this project is to create an analytics report that summarizes the click-through data collected by Hospice Palliative Care, Ontario (HPCO) from its Newsletter Subscribers. The results of this analysis will help HPCO decide on the right marketing strategy to drive up subscriptions as well as subscriber engagement with their publications.

The raw data was obtained from HPCO constant contact data, which needed further specialized attention, breaking down the numbers, to obtain data that excluded HPCO employees, who were also subscribers to the Newsletter.

The tools used for executing this project was:

1. Microsoft Excel, which was useful in initial analysis and rearrangement of the data, for upload into the Business Intelligence Modeling tool.
2. Microsoft Power BI, the modeling tool, into which the data processed from Excel was imported, subsequently modeled, and manipulated to generate visuals for easy communication of the findings of the report to the Client (HPCO)

The final deliverable of this Project consisted of slide presentations of summary click-through data, and visual reports for each newsletter edition for the year in focus(June 10, 2020, to June 9, 2021). Some key insights to be gleaned from this reporting were the top clicks and bottom clicks with the click-rate data, as well as the types of information contained in those articles within the newsletter which received the most or least number of clicks. This does give clarity to the publishers of the newsletter on what interests readers, and how they can tailor their content creation to maximixe reader participation in the Hospice Care activities.

Here is a summary report and a monthly dashboard created in Power BI.
