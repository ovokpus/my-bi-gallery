## Cliclet slicer

This visual was created as part of a technical evaluation in a job hiring process.

### The Challenge

A `test.csv` file was given with 3 columns:

Unit number: unique identifier of some engines
RUL: remaining life cycle of those engines
Status: enginesâ€™ status

A jupyter notebook `status_canvas.ipynb` was also given, visualizing the remaining life cycle of all engines in one canvas. This was an implementation done using `tkinter`, a python library for building User Interfaces. Python is not the first choice for visualization.

Challenge files are linked in the [assets folder]()

Challenge Question: Do you think we can build this canvas in PowerBI or any other visualization tool that you choose? Do you think we can communicate the information shown in the canvas better?

My solution is here, using a custom PowerBI visual called a `cliclet_slicer`

## Superstore Sales and Profit Data

This was created with hands-on participating in a PowerBI course. Here I created an interactive dashboard, visible from the PowerBI service
